# Day 14 â€“ Higher Lower Game ðŸ“Š

A terminal-based game where the user compares two personalities and guesses who has more Instagram followers.

## Features

- Randomly selected public figures with name, profession, and country
- Player guesses who has more followers: A or B
- Score increases with correct answers
- B becomes new A in the next round
- Game continues until a wrong guess
- Final score is shown at the end
- Clean ASCII visuals for logo and comparison

## How It Works

- The game selects two random entries from a dataset.
- The player sees both figuresâ€™ names, descriptions, and countries.
- The player chooses who they believe has more followers.
- If correct, the score increases and the game continues.
- If incorrect, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
